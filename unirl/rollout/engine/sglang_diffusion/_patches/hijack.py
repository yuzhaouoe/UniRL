"""In-process monkey-patch installer for stock-upstream sglang diffusion (LIN-365).

Mirrors ``unirl/rollout/engine/vllm_omni/vllm_patches.py``: a
spawn-propagating hijack that re-hosts the ``sglang-drl`` fork's RL additions on
top of stock upstream sglang, so UniRL can track upstream instead of
carrying a hard fork.

Why direct setattr/REPLACE (not sglang's HookRegistry): the diffusion
scheduler/worker runs under forced spawn
(``diffusion_generator.py: mp.set_start_method("spawn", force=True)``) and the
diffusion path never calls srt ``load_plugins()``, so the official
``HookRegistry`` is not wired in. A parent-only patch would silently no-op in
the worker; ``wrap_mp_process_for_children`` propagates the install into every
spawn child instead.

Install once when the native backend boots -- BEFORE importing
``DiffGenerator`` (which forces spawn at import) and before ``from_pretrained``
spawns the scheduler. Idempotent; safe to call from both parent and child.

        #     Ray worker's train-side FSDP setup (Remote.setup writes them into
        #     os.environ at remote.py:104). The scheduler subprocess is a fresh
        #     single-process dist world (num_gpus=1), but it inherits
        #     NCCL_TOPO_FILE pointing at a parent-process fd (/proc/self/fd/NNN)
        #     that doesn't exist here → NCCL ``new_group`` →
        #     ``eager_connect_single_device`` hangs on a dead pipe. The other
        #     NCCL knobs (SOCKET_IFNAME, BUFFSIZE, ...) are train-mesh-specific
        #     and have no correct value in this subprocess; let NCCL use
        #     defaults. gpu_worker.init_device_and_model re-sets MASTER_ADDR/
        #     MASTER_PORT/WORLD_SIZE/RANK before init_process_group, so those
        #     are not cleared. This hang is nondeterministic across workers
        #     (timing of NCCL topo detection), hence only some workers hit it.
        #
        # (2) HeartbeatMonitor SIGSEGV — after init_process_group succeeds, the
        #     NCCL HeartbeatMonitor thread starts and calls glibc ``getenv``
        #     (via DumpPipe::DumpPipe(int) → getCvarString) on a background
        #     thread. glibc ``getenv`` is NOT thread-safe: sglang's model-load
        #     path concurrently calls ``os.environ[k]=v`` (putenv, which may
        #     realloc the environ array) — e.g. lora_pipeline.py:33 sets
        #     TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM at import, gpu_worker.py:126-130 sets
        #     MASTER_ADDR/MASTER_PORT/... If the windows overlap →
        #     use-after-free → SIGSEGV in getenv. This is also timing-dependent
        #     (FlowGRPO 06-24 didn't hit it; NFT 06-25 did). Setting
        #     TORCH_NCCL_ENABLE_MONITORING=0 (verified against libtorch_cuda.so
        #     strings) fully disables the monitor thread; the monitor provides
        #     no value in a single-process (world_size=1) NCCL world.
        #
        # NOTE (torch 2.11): ``TORCH_NCCL_ENABLE_MONITORING`` does not exist in
        # this build (the monitor has no disable flag; only
        # ``TORCH_NCCL_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_SEC``). The monitor thread therefore
        # always starts after ``init_process_group``. The remaining race is the
        # monitor thread's glibc ``getenv`` vs ``os.environ[k]=v`` (``putenv``)
        # during model load — e.g. ``lora_pipeline.py:33`` sets
        # ``TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM`` at *import* time, and the lora module is
        # imported during model construction (after init_process_group).
        # Pre-setting ``TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM`` and pre-importing the lora
        # pipeline module here (before the scheduler target runs, hence before
        # ``init_process_group`` starts the monitor) eliminates the concurrent
        # ``putenv``: by the time the monitor thread calls ``getenv``, no
