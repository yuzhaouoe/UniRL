"""Typed, self-reserving TCP port sets for out-of-process inference engines.

A :class:`ReservedPorts` subclass declares one ``int`` field per port its
engine subprocess needs — declaration order is reservation order. The engine
reserves its own set at the last responsible moment (in its ctor, on its own
node, right before the spawn) via :meth:`ReservedPorts.reserve`; tests inject
fixed instances instead. This replaces per-engine ``base + rank * stride``
port math: bind-to-zero de-synchronizes colocated engines (each draws
different ephemeral ports from the node's kernel), with no builder-side
machinery.

Reservation is a *hint*, not a contract: the sockets are closed immediately
after binding (the subprocess must be able to bind them itself), so the usual
bind-to-zero TOCTOU gap applies — the same trade-off ``sglang_llm``'s
``find_free_port`` already accepts, and SGLang's ``settle_port`` self-heals
the rare loss. Port *ranges* (vllm_omni-style stride scans) are a different
reservation primitive and out of scope here.
