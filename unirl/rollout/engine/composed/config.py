"""Composed rollout-engine configuration.

Registered under ``rollout/engine: composed_pe`` with ``_target_`` pointing at
:class:`ComposedRolloutEngine`. The composed engine holds two child engines
(``ar`` and ``diffusion``) and orchestrates the prompt-enhancement (PE)
serial flow internally — it is a peer of the existing ``sglang``,
``sglang_llm``, ``vllm_omni``, and ``trainside`` engines as far as the
actor / pipeline layer is concerned.

Each child (``ar`` / ``diffusion``) is a rollout engine config carrying its
own ``_target_``; the worker walker constructs it from the recipe and
``ComposedRolloutEngine`` builds the engine via ``config.<child>.make_engine``.
