"""ColocateStoreTransport — TensorTransport over a worker-local TensorStore.

The store lives in the Worker process, so put/get are per-tensor dict ops (no IPC, no
batching). Cross-device moves use the store's NCCL path; ref-counting delegates to the
store. WORKER_LOCAL, GPU-resident default backend.

Single-slot per device: colocate runs one Worker per GPU (DevicePool enforces
``workers_per_device == 1`` for this backend). Colocated multi-slot is gpu_store's job —
its shared per-GPU TensorWorker handles same-GPU sharing without per-process IPC. So
colocate never needs CUDA-IPC: a ref is either local to this worker or on another
device (→ NCCL). Multi-device (all slot0) is supported and leak-free.

Only the store-specific methods are overridden. Batched resolve/pack (get_batch /
put_batch) and the remote-compute helpers (tensor_op /
get_cpu) inherit the ABC defaults — those build on this class's get/put, so the defaults
are already correct (and local).
