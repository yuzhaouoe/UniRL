"""Base class for v2 full-(base-)weight sync handlers.

Counterpart to ``weight_sync/lora.py`` (LoRA-only). A ``FullWeightSync``
lives on the TRAIN slab as a sibling ``Remote`` of the FSDP backend (and, in
shared-process colocate, of the rollout engine) and pushes the freshly-trained
*full* weights into the rollout engine(s).

Subclasses pick a transport:
  - ``nccl.NCCLWeightSync``   — separate slabs (cross-node capable).
  - ``tensor.TensorWeightSync`` — colocate (serialized-tensor handoff).
  - ``ipc.IPCWeightSync``     — colocate (bucketed CUDA-IPC over ZMQ).

The base provides the transport-agnostic weight walk: full-tensor
materialization (FSDP shard → replicated, a train-mesh collective) and
size-bounded bucketing. All model / torch-heavy imports are deferred into the
methods so the driver can import this module to reference the class for
``remote(...)`` without eagerly pulling torch.

class FullWeightSync(Remote):
    """Base for full-weight sync Remotes.

    Subclasses implement ``sync()`` (push current weights) plus whatever
    one-time connection setup their transport needs. ``backend`` is the FSDP
    backend sibling whose ``.model`` is the weight source.

    ``lora_merged`` selects what gets pushed: ``False`` (default) syncs the raw
    base weights (meaningful for full fine-tuning); ``True`` folds the trained
    LoRA deltas into the base weights and pushes the merged full model
    (meaningful for a LoRA run served without a separate adapter).

    ``track_prefix`` routes the push to one child of a ``ComposedRolloutEngine``
    (e.g. ``"ar"`` / ``"diffusion"``); empty (default) targets a single-model
    engine. Each transport forwards it to the rollout so the receiver demuxes.

    ``wire_dtype`` (e.g. ``"bf16"``) casts floating tensors to the rollout
    engine's dtype in the weight walk — shard-side, BEFORE the FSDP
    all-gather — so the gather, the bucket sizing, and every transport move
    wire-width bytes. Set it in the ``sync:`` block whenever the training
    masters are wider than the engine (``model_precision: fp32`` →
    ``wire_dtype: bf16``). Receivers ``copy_``-cast on load, so this is a
    bandwidth/memory policy, not a correctness one; ``None`` (default) ships
    tensors as-is.

        on every train rank in lockstep; each yields a full (unsharded) CUDA
        tensor per param, in a deterministic order.
