"""v2 full-weight tensor-payload sync (COLOCATE).

Pushes the trained FSDP full base weights into a co-located vLLM-Omni rollout
engine by serializing each bucket (SGLang ``FlattenedTensorBucket`` +
``MultiprocessingSerializer``) and handing it to the local engine sibling's
``update_weights_from_tensor`` — the engine owns the Worker→Omni-subprocess
transfer (serialize already done; ``collective_rpc`` fans to the stage workers).

Full-weight analogue of ``weight_sync/lora/local.py:LocalLoraWeightSync`` and the v2
transport-mate of v1 ``distributed/weight_sync/tensor.py``. Colocate only:
``backend`` and ``rollout`` arrive as LOCAL siblings (same Worker process), so
the v1 cross-rank ``gather_object``/gloo-subgroup logic is unnecessary — each
train rank ships to its own co-located engine, and (TP=1) the worker picks
``serialized_named_tensors[0]``.

Scope: single-node, TP=1; a single-model engine, or one child of a
``ComposedRolloutEngine`` (via ``track_prefix``). All model / sglang imports are
deferred so the driver can import this module for ``remote(...)``.
