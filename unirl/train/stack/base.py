"""Family-agnostic single-stage train stack.

:class:`TrainStack` wraps one :class:`FSDPBackend` (training state: model +
optimizer + scheduler + EMA) and one :class:`StageAlgorithm` (loss + backward
against the bundle's trainable module) into a single-stage training driver. One
stack = one training track.

It owns the entire family-agnostic pipeline — device alignment, the π_old anchor
freeze, the per-update micro-accumulation loop, EMA, metrics — and defers exactly
ONE decision to an injected :class:`~unirl.train.stack.planner.MicroPlanner`
(composition, not inheritance): how each update's samples are grouped into
micro-batches. :class:`~unirl.train.stack.planner.CountPlanner` (the default)
groups by fixed count; :class:`~unirl.train.stack.planner.TokenBudgetPlanner`
packs by token budget. Swapping the strategy is a recipe-level ``micro_planner``
block, no subclass.

Sequencing per :meth:`train_track` call (one rollout)::

    track, plans = micro_planner.arrange(track)  # reorder (if packing) + plan
    prepare_segment(track, plans)                # once: freeze the π_old anchor
    for micros in plans:                         # num_updates_per_batch updates
        _run_update(track, micros=micros)        # one optimizer step each
    on_rollout_end()                             # once: EMA / rollout boundary

**Sort-then-slice.** Variable-length packing wants to group samples of similar
length, which would normally force arbitrary index lists threaded through the
whole pipeline. Instead the planner *reorders the track once up front* (length-sort
within each update, see :meth:`~unirl.train.stack.planner.TokenBudgetPlanner.arrange`)
so every micro is again a **contiguous** ``(start, end)`` range — exactly the
count-based geometry. The stack therefore only ever slices, and the anchor
reassembly is a plain ordered ``cat``; all packing-specific logic lives in the
planner (a no-op for :class:`~unirl.train.stack.planner.CountPlanner`).

``num_updates_per_batch`` partitions the rollout batch into that many disjoint
updates and runs one optimizer step per update — the FlowGRPO / DanceGRPO
schedule. Because ``prepare_segment`` captures the pre-update policy once, every
update shares the same PPO anchor; this is only correct for algorithms with
``supports_multi_update`` (the ctor enforces it). Defaults to 1.
