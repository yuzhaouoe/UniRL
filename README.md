## About 💡

UniRL applies one RL post-training loop — generate samples, score them, compute
advantages, update the policy, and sync weights back to rollout workers —
across multimodal model families.

</div>

UniRL is a layered, composable system. Each **entrypoint** (`train_diffusion`,
`train_ar`, `train_pe`, `train_unified_model`) loads a **Hydra example config**
covering model, algorithm, rollout, reward, placement, and sync, then creates the
matching domain **trainer** (`DiffusionTrainer`, `ARTrainer`, `PETrainer`,
`UnifiedModelTrainer`). The trainer coordinates the RL loop across pluggable
**rollout engines**, **algorithms**, **model bundles**, **reward services**, and
the shared **distributed runtime**: Ray `DevicePool`, FSDP, Transfer
Queue (TQ), and LoRA/full-weight sync. See [`unirl/README.md`](unirl/README.md) for the
runtime loop, deployment modes, and module map.

## Team-Proposed Algorithms 🌟

> **🌟 These algorithms are proposed by our team — the highlight of UniRL.** Each
> algorithm's folder holds a step-by-step tutorial and a runnable example recipe.
> We highly recommend trying them in our framework!

| Algorithm | Paper | Tutorial | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Flow-DPPO** | [*"Flow-DPPO: Divergence Proximal Policy Optimization for Flow Matching Models"*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.11025) | [FlowDPPO/](FlowDPPO/) | Diffusion/flow RL with an exact divergence-based trust-region mask. |
| **DRPO** | [*"Rethinking the Divergence Regularization in LLM RL"*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.09821) | [DRPO/](DRPO/) | Token-level LLM RL with a smooth advantage-weighted quadratic regularizer. |
| **CPPO** | [*"Beyond Uniform Token-Level Trust Region in LLM Reinforcement Learning"*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.10968) | [CPPO/](CPPO/) | Token-level LLM RL with a position-weighted, cumulative-prefix-budget Binary-TV mask. |

UniRL also wires in standard reference algorithms — **(LLM's)GRPO**, **DiffusionNFT**,
**DanceGRPO**, and **MixGRPO** — in [`unirl/algorithms/`](unirl/algorithms/README.md).

## Model Support 🎨

Model and algorithm support are **two independent dimensions** that compose within
a domain: any diffusion algorithm (see above) runs on a diffusion
model, AR algorithms on AR models — so UniRL covers many more model × algorithm
combinations than the shipped example recipes alone. The table below is the model
dimension; all listed models are supported (✅).

<div align="center">

| Model | Category | Modality | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stable Diffusion 3 / 3.5 | Image diffusion | Text → Image | ✅ |
| Qwen-Image | Image diffusion | Text → Image | ✅ |
| FLUX.2-Klein | Image diffusion | Text → Image / Text + Image → Image | ✅ |
| Z-Image | Image diffusion | Text → Image | ✅ |
| WAN 2.1 | Video diffusion | Text / Image → Video | ✅ |
| WAN 2.2 | Video diffusion | Text / Image → Video | ✅ |
| HunyuanVideo 1.0 / 1.5 | Video diffusion | Text → Video | ✅ |
| Qwen-VL | Vision-language AR | Text + Image → Text | ✅ |
| Qwen3 | LLM AR | Text → Text | ✅ |
| Prompt-Enhancer | LLM + diffusion | Text → Text → Image | ✅ |
| HunyuanImage3 | Unified AR + diffusion | Text → Image | ✅ |
| Bagel | Unified AR + diffusion | Text → Image | ✅ |

</div>

Each model maps to a domain entrypoint (`train_diffusion`, `train_ar`, `train_pe`,
`train_unified_model`); see **Getting Started** below to run any of them.

## Training Modes 🧩

UniRL unifies four training modes, one Hydra example bucket and entrypoint each.
Examples are self-contained YAML files selected with
`--config-name=<domain>/<example>`:

| Domain | Trains | Entrypoint | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `diffusion/` | Image / video diffusion models | `train_diffusion` | `diffusion/sd3/sd3_sglang_rollout_colocate` |
| `ar/` | Autoregressive models — vision-language (VLM) + text-only (LLM) | `train_ar` | `ar/qwen_vl_grpo_geo3k_mc_4x8`, `ar/qwen3_drpo_4b_base_dapo_sglang` |
| `pe/` | Prompt-enhancer (AR rewriter + diffusion reward) | `train_pe` | `pe/pe_sglang_full_pickscore` |
| `unified_model/` | Unified AR + diffusion models | `train_unified_model` | `unified_model/hi3_vllmomni` |

See [`examples/README.md`](examples/README.md) for the full launch guide, naming
schema, and how to add a recipe.

## Getting Started ⚡

Install dependencies first — see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

```bash
# compose-check, then launch a single-node example
python -m unirl.train_diffusion --config-name=diffusion/sd3/sd3_trainside --cfg job --resolve
bash examples/run_experiment_single_node.sh diffusion/sd3/sd3_trainside
```

## Roadmap 🗺️

We are actively expanding model and algorithm coverage. Near-term directions:

- Broaden algorithm coverage for the newer model families — FLUX.2-Klein,
  HunyuanVideo 1.0 / 1.5, and Bagel.
- Extend the team-proposed algorithms (Flow-DPPO, DRPO) to more model families.
- Broaden reward backends and rollout-engine coverage across domains.
