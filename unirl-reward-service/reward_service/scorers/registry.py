"""Registry mapping scorer-name → BaseScorer subclass.

Each concrete scorer module calls `register(name, cls)` at import time.
If a scorer's optional dep is missing its ImportError is reported as a
warning (so users can see why a reward didn't register) but swallowed —
the service only hard-fails when that reward is actually configured.
